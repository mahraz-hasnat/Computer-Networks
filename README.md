# Design a full-fledged network for an organization with multiple subnets.

Your task is to create a complete model of a complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the systems and subnetworks,
which will reflect the International APOLLO University’s structure and facilities, features within the network will include the followings:

 Web page of the university will reflect International Apollo University’s web page.
 DNS sever needs to be installed to locate webserver 
  - meaning people will browse University’s web site with the following address: http://web.internationalapollo.edu
 Among the hosts make sure wireless links to the networks are available.
 University’s full network has covered its six campuses with six routers;
  Connections between the campus routers are given at the end of handout.
 Connectivity between all the hosts needs to be established.

While designing, keep the issue of future expansion/growth in mind for each of the subnets
(if required) and preserve spaces. It is compulsory to incorporate wireless devices
along with wired hosts in the LAN as well. In the physical design, it is a good practice to have a server room
where all the servers are positioned in one LAN segment.
